# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within NobodyWho, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly
2. Send a direct message to the maintainers through:
   - Discord: Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/qhaMc2qCYB) and message an admin
   - Matrix: Contact us on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#nobodywho:matrix.org)
   - Email: [services@artificialmind.ai](services@artificialmind.ai)

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours and will send you regular updates about our progress.

## Security Considerations

NobodyWho runs LLMs locally on your machine. While this eliminates many traditional security concerns associated with cloud-based AI services, please be aware of:

1. Model file integrity - Only download models from trusted sources
3. Input validation - Be cautious with user input that gets passed to the LLM
4. Output safety - LLM outputs should be treated as untrusted content

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask you to:
- Give us reasonable time to fix the issue before disclosing it
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service interruption
- Not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue
